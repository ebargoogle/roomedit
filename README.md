CouchDB application for a 2D cloud-based room editor.

Display and edit 2D room, furniture and equipment layout.

The model, level, room, furniture and symbol data is stored in a cloud-based CouchDB data repository.

This data is queried and displayed on a browser on any device, including tablets and smartphones, using server-side scripting in JavaScript.

It generates HTML and SVG code to:

* Navigate the model
* Display the room and furniture graphically using SVG
* Edit the furniture position and rotation interactively.
* Update the data repository with new placement data.
